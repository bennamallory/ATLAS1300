#                  Made the for loops for each shape into generalized functions with variables replacing hard code
#                  Added if else statements to correspond color with desired shape xCord and yCord from original code within generalized functions
#                  Shape functions resulted in output with more randomness - either more shapes or less shapes
#                  Added makeArt() function to group commands that generate art
#                  Removed creation of turtle that was not used
#                  Added math module to create dimmensions of square background as some number to the second power


#Import random elements and math modules
from random import randint
import math

#Create Empty Background
x = 25
picHeight = math.pow(x,2)
picWidth = math.pow(x,2)
pic = makeEmptyPicture(int(picHeight),int(picWidth),black)

 
#Methods for making shapes:

#Method to create a rectangle of specified color
