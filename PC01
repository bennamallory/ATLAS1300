# Description   : This program provides methods for turning an image of Jeff Bezos into art


#Import image to manipulate (in this case, Jeff Bezos)
myFile = pickAFile()
pict = makePicture(myFile)
canvas = makeEmptyPicture(getWidth(pict) + 100, getHeight(pict) + 100, makeColor(146,44,136))
canvas2 = makeEmptyPicture(getWidth(canvas) + 100, getHeight(canvas) + 100,makeColor(180,44,136))

#Method to run Program
def makeArt():
  addGlasses()
  tintBlue()
  addBorder()
  addName()
  colorDistance()
  show(canvas2)

#Method to add glasses
def addGlasses():
  #Left oval of glasses
  addOvalFilled(pict,185,110,60,60,black)
  addOval(pict,185,110,60,60,white)
  #Right oval of glasses
  addOvalFilled(pict,278,120,40,40,black)
  addOval(pict,278,120,40,40,white)
  #Add arc over nose
  addArc(pict,225,130,75,75,60,60,black)
  #Add earpiece
  addLine(pict,191,134,81,137,black)

#Method to add borders
def addBorder():
  #add closest border
  newPict = copyInto(pict, canvas,50, 50)
  #add outermost border
  finalPict = copyInto(newPict,canvas2,50,50)

#Method to print the value of the color distance from blue (0,0,255) for the pixel located at (100,100)
def colorDistance():
  pixel = getPixel(pict,100,100)
  color_pix = getColor(pixel)
  dist = distance(blue,color_pix)
  printNow("Distance from blue for the pixel located at (100,100) is: ")
  printNow(dist)

#Method to tint the image blue
def tintBlue():
  for pixel in getPixels(pict):
    value = getRed(pixel)
    setBlue(pixel,180)   

def addName():
  import java.awt.Font as Font
  str = "Jeff B"
  myFont = makeStyle("Comic Sans", Font.BOLD,93)
  addTextWithStyle(canvas2,60,530,str,myFont,white)

#Run Program
